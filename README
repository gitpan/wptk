wptk is a poor man's windowing shell.  Like its Tcl/Tk counterpart, wptk
automatically creates a MainWindow for you, sources your Perl/Tk program,
then invokes MainLoop.  This means you do not have to write 5-10 lines
of pTk boiler-plate code over and over again.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Then read wptk.pod for more details.
